30% of 100%
[#################--------------------------------------]

This project should show my ability to work with: 
- Ð¡lean architecture
- Mvvm
- Dagger 2
- RxJava 2
- Firebase:
  - [Firebase Cloud Messaging ](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging)
  - [Firebase Cloud Store](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
- [Fresco](https://frescolib.org/)

Plans:
In the future I plan to set up work with the database, message notifications, and all other logic that does not concern Ui

I apologize for not being able to finish the project on time, there were health problems for a long time, and the last week I was sick.
